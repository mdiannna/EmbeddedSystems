This sketch shows how to use the SFE_BMP180 library to read the
Bosch BMP180 barometric pressure sensor.
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11824

Like most pressure sensors, the BMP180 measures absolute pressure.
This is the actual ambient pressure seen by the device, which will
vary with both altitude and weather.

Before taking a pressure reading you must take a temperature reading.
This is done with startTemperature() and getTemperature().
The result is in degrees C.

Once you have a temperature reading, you can take a pressure reading.
This is done with startPressure() and getPressure().
The result is in millibar (mb) aka hectopascals (hPa).

If you'll be monitoring weather patterns, you will probably want to
remove the effects of altitude. This will produce readings that can
be compared to the published pressure readings from other locations.
To do this, use the sealevel() function. You will need to provide
the known altitude at which the pressure was measured.

If you want to measure altitude, you will need to know the pressure
at a baseline altitude. This can be average sealevel pressure, or
a previous pressure reading at your altitude, in which case
subsequent altitude readings will be + or - the initial baseline.
This is done with the altitude() function.

Hardware connections:

- (GND) to GND
+ (VDD) to 3.3V

(WARNING: do not connect + to 5V or the sensor will be damaged!)

You will also need to connect the I2C pins (SCL and SDA) to your
Arduino.


The SFE_BMP180 library uses floating-point equations developed by the
Weather Station Data Logger project: http://wmrx00.sourceforge.net/

Our example code uses the "beerware" license. You can do anything
you like with this code. No really, anything. If you find it useful,
buy me a beer someday.
